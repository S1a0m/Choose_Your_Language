This is a test lib.

In fact, it's the famous coDS project in a simpler way, in a small Rust lib, in a dumber way. I'm kidding ğŸ˜…. Even if it's a bit true. The coDS project was already ambitious for the little beginner that I was. But the code was almost disgusting ğŸ¥´.

It's planned for a future Slint/Rust gui app. But you can test it and use it.

Even if it doesn't have any documentation.
